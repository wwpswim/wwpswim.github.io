		<h3><b>Who we are</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p>The West Windsor-Plainsboro North Knights Swimming Booster Club is a parent run organization whose objective is the support of the West Windsor-Plainsboro North Knights High School Swim Team. Members of the booster club are the parents/guardian of the swim team members. If your child is on the team, you are now a member of the Booster Club. Welcome!!</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>What we do</b></h3>
    <br>
    <p>All of our activities are directed toward building support for our swimmers and coaches. We do this by promoting and encouraging student and parent attendance at home and away meets. We also provide supplementary financial support by funding some (or all) of the purchase of equipment, supplies, apparel, and other items. Examples include the purchase of a computer, Lane line and storage reel for the team, the cost of decorations for especially important meets, some team apparel, athlete awards and memorabilia, and support of an end of year banquet. The banquet allows swimmers and parents alike to celebrate the team’s progress during the year, say farewell to the graduating senior swimmers. Parent Booster Club volunteers organize and operate the end of the season banquet as well as the fundraising activities.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><b>What we sponser</b></h3>
    <br>
    <h5>Knights Swim-A-Thon:</h5>
    <p>The Swim-A-Thon is held during normal practice hours on Saturday DecemberJanuary, and is consist of 100 laps. Swimmers should ask for and collect the pledges in either a flat amount, or based on number of laps (e.g., $0.10 per lap). Swimmers should ask for pledges from family and friends- not door to door. All swimmers are required to participate with a minimum pledge collection of $25.00 per swimmer.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Concessions:</h5>
    <p>The Booster Club team parents stock and work the concessions stand at all the Home meets and at the County Swim meet. All team members are requested to provide a case of drinks and snacks to be sold. The profits realized from sales are an important and reliable source of support for our swimmers. Our dates are listed on the parent Sign-Up form. We also would like to use sign up genius. Emails will be sent out with available times.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Apparel:</h5>
    <p>The Booster Club coordinates measuring swimmers for team swim suits, integrating the sizing, color, artwork (chosen by team captains earlier in the year), placing and managing the order. We have online store for the swimmers to order items from the link: <br><a href="https://www.sneakersplus.com/teamsproductslist.aspx?teamID=1845">https://www.sneakersplus.com/teamsproductslist.aspx?teamID=1845</a><br>

    The swimmers will be responsible for buying their own suits plus any other High School North apparel they may desire. The price of the girl’s suit is $75.00, the boy’s Jammer is $55.00 and boy’s brief $45.00. The Booster Club provides the swimmers with one free latex team cap, a free tee shirt (one for the season and one for the Country meet at the end of the season), and provides the coaching staff with matching team polo shirts.</p>
    <br>
      <h5>End of Season Banquet</h5>
      <p>This is the capstone event of the swim season. The Booster Club arranges all the elements of this annual gathering. The swimmers and their families meet for an evening of relaxed dining and conversation, punctuated by recollections of the past season and public recognition of each team member’s contribution to it. We also take this opportunity say farewell and good luck to our departing seniors with  
      a full-sized photo of each senior swimmer autographed by the entire team. Finally, we end the evening by installing next season’s team captains who are selected by their teammates and coaches at the end of each season.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Parent Sponsered Activities</h3>
    <br>
    <h5>Pasta Parties:</h5>
    <p>Pasta parties may be organized by the Booster club which is usually “pot luck” style. Each grade level will be responsible for bringing some of the food. Parents are encouraged to have their swimmer participate in these events. These are not only excellent team-building activities but are a terrific opportunity for the swimmers to organize and carry out their own agenda. We plan the pasta parties for a night before a big meet.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Psych Parties:</h5>
    <p>Many parents open their homes to host the girls or boys swim team psych parties. These get-togethers are usually organized around a theme or specific objective the swimmers have agreed upon in advance. These parties are funded by the swimmers themselves and money is usually collected when they arrive at the home of the host swimmer. These parties have been very successful over the years because they are hosted and supervised by enthusiastic parents so we can rest easy while our children enjoy themselves.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Getting the season going:</h5>
    We are asking for all freshman and sophomores to donate a case of water. 12 to 16 ounce bottles please. Juniors and seniors are asked to donate a case of Gatorade. Also, each family is requested to contribute toward the concessions stand in the form of a box of candy, granola bars, and chips.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Tuesday and Thursdays the booster parents volunteer to provide bagels for the morning practice.</p>
